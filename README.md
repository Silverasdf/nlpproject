## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Look at and run the ipynb files (if you want)

## Milestone 1 Assignment

- Use word embeddings analysis to analyze select crime novels (up to three per author) available on project Gutenberg; by author Agatha Christie
- Do word embeddings-based analysis -- produce work embeddings for your author's works and use those to do similar analysis like with plot or author analysis but by using embeddings metrics to assess the plot;
implement a custom, ultra-simplified prompt interface to run your analysis

Agatha Christie -- analyze the novels' plot using word embeddings  

## Visualization

1. Run Tensorboard and go to localhost:6006 - tensorboard --logdir=./projector_files/
2. In the top-righthand corner select Projector
